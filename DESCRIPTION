Description: Social scientists may compute sum scores 
             to estimate latent constructs, even if 
             it might produce different outcomes as 
             compared to originally theorised and 
             tested measures. Although a number of 
             statistical packages already embed 
             estimations based on congeneric approaches, 
             this procedure could be not easily accessible
             for other types of analyses 
             (e.g., regression techniques, QCA, ANOVA, MANOVA,
             etc.). To support a larger audience of social 
             scientists, we develop an R package embedding an 
             open source, user-friendly Shiny app named CLC 
             (Congeneric Latent Construct) estimator for 
             the computation of latent constructs based on 
             congeneric approaches.
